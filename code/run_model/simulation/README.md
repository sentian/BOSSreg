The file '*run.R*' contains the code to reproduce the results in the paper where n>p. In the revision of the paper, we decided to include the simplified relaxed lasso, and the results are produced by running the file '*run_srlasso.R*'. We also performed simulation study for the case where n<=p, which is given by running '*run_highdim.R*'. Note that the R files are called by the sh files in order to be run on a HPC server in parallels.
